Glad to see you here!
👋 Hi there! I’m currently a 3rd-semester Computer Science student with a passion for tackling new challenges. I love diving into complex problems and learning new technologies along the way. My focus is on expanding my skills across different areas of computer science, from coding to problem-solving and beyond. I’m always on the lookout for exciting projects and collaborations that push my boundaries and help me grow.

Right now, I’m working on a timetable project using Tauri and Svelte for the frontend, with Express.js as the backend and SurrealDB as the database. This project is a great opportunity to dive deeper into full-stack development and experiment with new technologies.
